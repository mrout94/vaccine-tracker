# India Vaccine Tracker

Link to the website:- [Vaccine Tracker](www.google.com)

On 16th January 2021, PM Narendra Modi on behalf of the government of India declared the vaccination open for citizens of India (starting with the high-risk category of senior citizens). The official portal for registering for vaccination and booking appointments is [CoWin](https://www.cowin.gov.in/home). This portal requires Mobile number and basic identity verification for registering yourself for vaccination and has a OTP authentication system for further logins.

But as I and many people I know faced some challenges while logging into the portal to check available vaccination slots in their locality (probably due to huge traffic and enthusiasm of people), I have created this basic app which scrapes the data for next seven days and shows available slots in your locality graphically and in tabular format. This also incorporates various other filters like age, Pin, etc.

You can use this tool to know about any available slots for the selected area, copy the pin code and paste the same in t5he Cowin portal for fast and easy finding of vaccination centres.

Hope this helps!
